                        Very often we heard confused voices about maintanance of
                        earthen floors; some even say dirt flooring. But have
                        you heard of using linseed oil for earthen floor? Wax
                        polished smooth soothing earthly tone? How simple rice
                        husk or cactus juice can be used? <br />
                        Did you know there was a morter called ‚ÄúBojro lepa‚Äù in
                        the ancient villages of Mohasthangar? <br />

                        such as:

                        Apart from learning the techniques, what else will we
                        do? We will visit some of the earthen houses that were
                        damaged during cyclone Amphan or storm surge and
                        identify houses those can be repaired or rebuild. Then
                        start rebuilding with the adobe brick we all have made
                        during the workshop. <br />
